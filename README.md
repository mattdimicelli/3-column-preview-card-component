## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Tailwind CSS
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- Webpack

### What I learned

This was my second time ever using Tailwind CSS, so it was good practice.  I reinforced my knowledge of semantic HTML5, and I experienced the dilemma of "extracting" a custom class for repeated styles (such as the buttons) vs leaving them inline, which is part of the paradigm of Tailwind CSS.  I believe that I struck a useful balance.
